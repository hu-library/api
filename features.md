Looking for the ability:

- to receive information from an outside form

- for supervisors to add tasks and records

- to "pass on" a record to the next person in a chain, i.e. when a book is given up as lost, Aaron could pass (forward/clear the queue) to Mrs. Shelton.

- to mark an item as found (going in an archive). 
  - More broadly to assign a status to an item?

- timestamps

- to run reports--how many book search requests submitted, fiscal year.
  - How many books found?
  - How many truly lost?

- to cycle tasks or records that only need to be searched for once a month--to go out of the assignment queue 
  - into a holding place?
  - Or at least the ability to find them by status still 

- to mark "where" something has been searched for. (Aaron and Rebecca can get you specifics on this, but maybe we can get their process even more steamlined so that we can use pre-set terms rather than like a notes or comments field.
